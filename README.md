# Jayson Christopher Garrison

## About

My name is Jayson and I am a student at [*the University of Tulsa*](https://utulsa.edu/).
I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.

 ## Involvement

I research with [*TUMASTERS*](http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~sandip/research/web/home.html) in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
I am the Treasurer of [*TU's ACM chapter*](https://tuacm.com/).

## Current Work

I am currently taking courses in Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning and developing related projects.
My aim is to further my proficiency in Python as I learn to implement machine learning algorithms in it while
utilizing different libraries.

## Proficiencies 
- Algorithm design, analysis, and implementation
- Data Structure selection, comparison, and management
- Machine Learning model selection, testing, implementation, analysis, and presentation
- Artificial Intelligence agent construction, adaptation, human-agent collaboration, and presentation
- Object Oriented Programming
- Technical writing in LaTeX
- Linux development
- Bash terminal
- Version control (git)
- Significant project implementation (please see my ML projects)
- Operating Systems concepts, process syncronization, and deadlock avoidance
## Languages

I have developed significant AI/ML projects in Python using many packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
I have also developed several object oriented programming projects in Java.
## Hobbies

In my free time when I am not studying, I enjoy reading philosophical and spiritual works, praying, talking with friends, and being involved with my [*Newman*](https://www.tu-catholic.org/) community.
